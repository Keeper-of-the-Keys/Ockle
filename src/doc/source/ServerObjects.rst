Server Objects and Object Generators
====================================
In Ockle, a server holds a collection of *Server Objects* which the Ockle's :doc:`plugins` interact with.
A server object instance is created from an *Object Generator* class. Currently the types are: PDUs, Controllers and Testers. Those generate the Outlet, control and test objects respectively.
